        It was many and many a year ago, In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden
        there lived whom you may know By the name of Annabel Lee; And this
        maiden she lived with no other thought Than to love and be loved by me.

        I was a child and she was a child, In this kingdom by the sea, But we
        loved with a love that was more than love— I and my Annabel Lee— With a
        love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven Coveted her and me

        And this was the reason that, long ago, In this kingdom by the sea, A
        wind blew out of a cloud, chilling My beautiful Annabel Lee; So that her
        highborn kinsmen came And bore her away from me, To shut her up in a
        sepulchre In this kingdom by the sea.

        The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, Went envying her and me—
        Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know, In this kingdom by the sea)
        That the wind came out of the cloud by night, Chilling and killing my
        Annabel Lee.

        But our love it was stronger by far than the love Of those who were
        older than we— Of many far wiser than we— And neither the angels in
        Heaven above Nor the demons down under the sea Can ever dissever my soul
        from the soul Of the beautiful Annabel Lee
